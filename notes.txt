Animator component can directly reference its parameters:
anim = GetComponent<Animator>
anim.speed = 5;

KnockbackState should be a trigger in animation, transition from Any State, so that's 
how we avoid repeated transitions into the state from Any State in animator controller

Data structure for colliders will actually be a collection of scripts
Something like tree<IHittable>

IHittable would inherit from MonoBehaviour and have methods:
GetHit(damage);
OnDeath();
DoKnockback();
and Properties:
health
knockbackThreshold
Collider -> reference to the collider object that can be hit
