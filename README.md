Repository for development of Mechanic's Grove: a Unity3D game

This project will be my final project for GD50: CS50â€™s Introduction to Game Development<br>
<br>
The idea behind creating this repo is to be able to edit code or add ideas as soon as they come to me, as well as to document the following:<br>
- Problems I need to solve
- My learning process
- Features I want to implement in the game
- Concepts related to overall engineering of the project
<p>
I have a <a href="TODO.md">to-do list</a> attached to this to document those exact topics that will evolve as I learn and do more in this project
<p>
This will hopefully turn into a "Third Person Tower Defense" game. The idea is similar to other tower defense
games in that there will be enemies that come from some number of sources, and that will follow a path to try
to get to some number of end points. What will be relatively unique about this game is that the player 
will be one character, the mechanic, that will need to physically move around the map to fight enemies and build towers
