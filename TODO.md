-         Make first level in editor, then future levels make with code
-         No procedural level generation, fixed level design for each level
-             Maybe procedural for trees and rocks and cosmetics

-         Enemy pathfinding: series of empty game objects for enemies to walk towards? Split path and make them alternate between targets?
-             Implementation of graph theory? 
-             Levelmaker could pass it in to the enemy class and make the enemy choose a path
